# Product Roadmapping Tool

This Application pulls data from a Excel file and imports that data to create a complex, linear, product roadmap. The design behind this project closely resembles the theory within the MIT textbook "Technology Roadmapping and development" by Olivier Weck.

### Software Outline

This program will parse an Excel sheet (template within the Repo.) and pull data to create different charts. Each sheet within the file is related to different graphs within the end product (Either an interactive chart or an Image). 
The "Technology" sheet contains the data for the "Technology" chart within the graphic. The Y-Axis for this chart section is Impact Rating, provided by the user. The X-axis for this chart (and every chart in this graphic) is a unified timeline. The "Capabillities" sheet is similar to the "Technology" sheet in the way it is formatted, and the Y-Axis is the same.
